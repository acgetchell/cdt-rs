Causal Dynamical Triangulations using Constrained Delaunay Triangulations in Rust

## Introduction

For an introduction to Causal Dynamical Triangulations, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0105267).

## Roadmap

- [x] Use [Kani] to verify correctness
- [x] Use an existing Rust Delaunay triangulation library (e.g. [Spade]), or write one that can be verified by [Kani]?
- [x] 2D Delaunay triangulation
- [ ] 1+1 foliation
- [ ] 2D ergodic moves
- [ ] 2D Metropolis-Hastings
- [ ] Diffusion-accelerated MCMC?
- [ ] Visual output
- [ ] 3D Delaunay triangulation
- [ ] 2+1 foliation
- [ ] 3D ergodic moves
- [ ] 3D Metropolis-Hastings
- [ ] Visual output
- [ ] 4D Delaunay triangulation
- [ ] 3+1 foliation
- [ ] 4D ergodic moves
- [ ] 4D Metropolis-Hastings
- [ ] Initialize masses in 3D with Constrained Delaunay Triangulation
- [ ] Initialize masses in 4D with Constrained Delaunay Triangulation
- [ ] Shortest path
- [ ] Geodesic distance
- [ ] Einstein tensor
- [ ] Quantize spacetime!

## Issues

- [x] [Spade] 2.3.0 is [broken](https://github.com/Stoeoef/spade/issues/94) - Fixed with [Spade] 2.3.1
